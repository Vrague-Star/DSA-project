## Introduction

Employee Attrition Analysis is a project aimed at understanding the factors that lead to employee turnover in organizations. By analyzing various employee attributes, the project seeks to identify patterns and insights that can help improve retention strategies.

## Technologies Used

- Python

## Libraries

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Vrague-Star/DSA-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Project-2-Employee-Attrition
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the analysis script to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualize trends:
```
python analysis.py
```

You can also use Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration:
```
jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
```

## Scope of Functionality

This project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Feature engineering for predictive modeling.
- Insights and recommendations based on findings.

## Examples

### Example 1: Attrition Rate by Department
```
# Code snippet to visualize attrition by department
sns.barplot(x='Department', y='Attrition', data=dataset)
plt.show()
```

### Example 2: Predictive Modeling with Scikit-learn
```
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Project Status

The project is currently **in progress** with plans to add advanced predictive modeling techniques and a web-based dashboard for visualization.
